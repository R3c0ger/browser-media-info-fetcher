# Browser Media Information Fetcher

This is a simple Python script that fetches the title and key URL of a video in KuaiShou, Bilibili, Douyin, and YouTube, which is provided by a page(tab) in a browser like Firefox or Edge.

Too lazy to explain what it does. You can just watch a video in the YouTube on the Firefox, run it and see the result. Or throw the code to ChatGPT and let it explain to you.
